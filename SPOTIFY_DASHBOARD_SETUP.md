### 4. Add Redirect URIs

Scroll down to the **"Redirect URIs"** section and add:

#### For Local Testing:
```
http://localhost:8501/callback
```

#### For Streamlit Cloud Production:
```
https://YOUR-APP-NAME.streamlit.app/callback
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:**
- Replace `YOUR-APP-NAME` with your actual Streamlit app URL

## üìã Your Redirect URIs Should Look Like:

```
‚úÖ http://localhost:8501/callback
‚úÖ https://your-actual-app-name.streamlit.app/callback
```

---

## üîÑ After Deployment to Streamlit Cloud

Once you deploy and get your actual Streamlit URL:

1. **Copy the URL** (e.g., `https://my-spotify-app.streamlit.app`)
2. **Come back to this dashboard**
3. **Click "Edit Settings"** again
4. **Update** the second URI to use your actual app name
5. **Save**

---

## ‚úÖ Verification

Your app will show a debug message (in local mode):
```
üîß Debug: Using redirect URI: http://localhost:8501/callback
```

This MUST exactly match what you added in the Spotify Dashboard!

## üöÄ For Streamlit Cloud Secrets

When deploying, add these secrets:

```toml
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = "6cbce910215e41c0bf09c3b36d31a953"
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = "4dae86192be14c51b5b9ccf871c8239b"
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = "https://your-actual-app-name.streamlit.app/callback"
```

Replace `your-actual-app-name` with your real Streamlit URL!

---

## ‚ùå Common Mistakes

- Missing `/callback` path
- Using `http://` for Streamlit Cloud (should be `https://`)
- Forgetting to click "Add" before clicking "Save"
- Typo in the app name
- Extra spaces before or after the URI

---

## ‚ú® Quick Test

After setting up:

1. Open your local app: http://localhost:8506 (or current port)
2. Check the debug message shows correct URI
3. Click "üîê Connect Spotify"
4. Should redirect to Spotify login
5. After login, should redirect back to your app
6. Profile picture and name should appear in sidebar

If it fails: Double-check the URIs match EXACTLY! ‚úèÔ∏è
