# üîê Spotify OAuth Setup Guide

## Issue: "INVALID_CLIENT" Error

If you're seeing an **INVALID_CLIENT** error when trying to connect your Spotify account, follow this guide to fix it.

## What Causes This Error?

The INVALID_CLIENT error occurs when:
1. ‚ùå Redirect URI doesn't match between Spotify Dashboard and Streamlit Secrets
2. ‚ùå Client ID or Client Secret is incorrect
3. ‚ùå Redirect URI wasn't saved in Spotify Dashboard

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Get Your App URL

Your Streamlit app URL should be something like:
```
https://enterpriseaidemo1websearch-bguldwgonwx8mtucjwymbq.streamlit.app
```

**Important:** Note the exact URL (copy it from your browser address bar)

### Step 2: Configure Spotify Developer Dashboard

1. **Go to Spotify Developer Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
   - Log in with your Spotify account

2. **Open Your App:**
   - Click on your app (or create a new one if you don't have one)
   - Click "Settings" (top right)

3. **Add Redirect URI:**
   - Scroll to "Redirect URIs" section
   - Click "Edit"
   - Add your Streamlit app URL EXACTLY as shown:
     ```
     https://your-actual-app-url.streamlit.app
     ```
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **DO NOT add a trailing slash** (`/`)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Must be `https://`** not `http://`
   - Click "Add"
   - Click **"SAVE"** at the bottom (very important!)

4. **Copy Your Credentials:**
   - Client ID: (copy from dashboard)
   - Click "View client secret" and copy it

### Step 3: Configure Streamlit Cloud Secrets

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Visit: https://share.streamlit.io
   - Find your app
   - Click the ‚ãÆ menu ‚Üí "Settings"

2. **Add Secrets:**
   - Click on the "Secrets" section
   - Add the following (replace with YOUR values):

   ```toml
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = "abc123youractualclientid456"
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = "def789youractualsecret012"
   SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = "https://your-actual-app-url.streamlit.app"
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ No extra spaces before or after values
   - ‚úÖ Redirect URI matches EXACTLY what you added to Spotify Dashboard
   - ‚úÖ Using `https://` not `http://`
   - ‚úÖ No trailing slash at the end

4. **Save:**
   - Click "Save"
   - Wait for app to restart (30-60 seconds)

### Step 4: Test the Connection

1. Reload your Streamlit app
2. Click "üîê Connect Spotify" button
3. Click the authorization link
4. You should be redirected to Spotify to approve
5. After approving, you'll be redirected back to your app
6. ‚úÖ Success! You should see "Successfully connected to Spotify!"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ‚ùå Wrong Redirect URI Format

**WRONG:**
```
http://myapp.streamlit.app/
https://myapp.streamlit.app/  (has trailing slash)
myapp.streamlit.app  (missing https://)
```

**CORRECT:**
```
https://myapp.streamlit.app
```

### ‚ùå Copy-Paste Errors

- Extra spaces: `" abc123 "` ‚Üê wrong
- Wrong quotes: Use straight quotes `"` not curly `""`
- Missing quotes in TOML secrets

### ‚ùå Forgot to Save

- After adding redirect URI to Spotify Dashboard, you MUST click "Save"
- After editing Streamlit secrets, you MUST click "Save"

## Troubleshooting Checklist

If it still doesn't work, check:

- [ ] Spotify Dashboard shows your redirect URI in the list
- [ ] Redirect URI has NO trailing slash
- [ ] Using `https://` (not `http://`)
- [ ] Client ID matches exactly (check for typos)
- [ ] Client Secret matches exactly
- [ ] Clicked "Save" in both Spotify Dashboard and Streamlit Cloud
- [ ] Waited 60 seconds for Streamlit app to restart after saving secrets
- [ ] Tried clearing browser cache or using incognito mode

## Still Having Issues?

### Check the Error Details

The app now shows a troubleshooting section when you expand "‚öôÔ∏è Troubleshooting OAuth Connection". It will display:
- Current Redirect URI being used
- Common issues and fixes
- Step-by-step instructions

### Alternative: Use Without OAuth

Good news! The app works perfectly fine **without** OAuth. You'll get:
- ‚úÖ All mood-based recommendations
- ‚úÖ Audio feature customization
- ‚úÖ Search-based song discovery

You just won't have:
- ‚ùå Personalized recommendations from YOUR library
- ‚ùå Access to your liked songs
- ‚ùå Ability to save playlists to your account

To use without OAuth, simply don't click "Connect Spotify" and use the app as-is!

## Example Configuration

Here's a real example (with fake credentials):

**Spotify Dashboard:**

Client Secret: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
Redirect URIs:
  - https://mood2music.streamlit.app
```

**Streamlit Cloud Secrets:**
```toml
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID = "7a8b9c0d1e2f3g4h5i6j7k8l9m0n1o2p"
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET = "a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6"
SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI = "https://mood2music.streamlit.app"
```
