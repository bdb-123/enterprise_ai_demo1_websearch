## Technical Details

### How Mood Extraction Works
1. **Text Analysis**: Scans your message for activity and mood keywords
2. **Mood Mapping**: Maps keywords to preset moods (Happy, Chill, Focus, Sad, Hype, Romantic)
3. **Feature Selection**: Selects appropriate audio features:
   - **Happy**: valence=0.8, energy=0.7, danceability=0.7, tempo=120
   - **Chill**: valence=0.5, energy=0.3, danceability=0.4, tempo=90
   - **Focus**: valence=0.4, energy=0.4, danceability=0.3, tempo=100
   - **Sad**: valence=0.2, energy=0.3, danceability=0.3, tempo=80
   - **Hype**: valence=0.7, energy=0.9, danceability=0.8, tempo=140
   - **Romantic**: valence=0.6, energy=0.4, danceability=0.5, tempo=95

### How Recommendations Work
1. **Library Sampling**: Gets up to 100 random songs from your liked songs
2. **Audio Analysis**: Fetches audio features from Spotify API
3. **Scoring**: Calculates match score for each song:
   ```python
   score = abs(track_valence - target_valence) * 2.0 +
           abs(track_energy - target_energy) * 1.5 +
           abs(track_danceability - target_danceability) * 1.2
   ```
4. **Ranking**: Sorts by best match (lowest score = best match)
5. **Selection**: Returns top 10 matches

### Session State
- Chat history stored in `st.session_state.chat_messages`
