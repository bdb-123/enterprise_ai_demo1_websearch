# Mood-to-Genre Matching Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the Spotify Mood2Music app to ensure each mood shows songs that **actually match** the mood's audio characteristics, not just keyword searches.

## Problems Solved

### Before
- Used generic search queries with keywords like "happy" or "sad"
- Hardcoded genres for all moods: `["pop", "indie-pop", "electronic"]`
- **No validation** that returned tracks actually matched the mood's audio features
- Could return upbeat songs for "Sad" mood if they had "sad" in the title

### After
- ✅ Mood-specific genre seeds for better initial search
- ✅ Audio feature validation using Spotify's audio analysis
- ✅ Weighted scoring system to rank track matches
- ✅ Multi-stage fallback strategy to ensure results

## Key Improvements

### 1. Mood-Specific Genre Seeds
Each mood now has carefully selected genres that match its characteristics:

```python
"Happy"    -> ["pop", "dance", "party", "funk", "disco"]
"Chill"    -> ["ambient", "chill", "indie", "acoustic", "lo-fi"]
"Focus"    -> ["ambient", "classical", "piano", "study", "minimal-techno"]
"Sad"      -> ["acoustic", "singer-songwriter", "indie", "sad", "emo"]
"Hype"     -> ["edm", "hip-hop", "rock", "hardstyle", "dubstep"]
"Romantic" -> ["romance", "r-n-b", "soul", "indie-pop", "pop"]
```

### 2. Audio Feature Scoring
Implemented `score_track_match()` that calculates how well a track matches the target mood:

**Scoring Weights:**
- **Valence** (positivity): 2.5x weight - most important for mood
- **Energy**: 2.0x weight - crucial for mood intensity
- **Danceability**: 1.5x weight - moderate importance
- **Tempo**: 1.0x weight - supporting characteristic

**Lower score = better match** (0 = perfect match)

### 3. Track Filtering Pipeline
Added `filter_tracks_by_mood()` that:

1. Fetches audio features for all search results (up to 50 tracks)
2. Scores each track against target mood features
3. Sorts by best match (lowest score)
4. Returns only the top N tracks that best match the mood

### 4. Improved Search Strategy
Multi-stage fallback ensures results while preferring quality:

1. **Primary**: Mood keywords + year filter + audio feature validation
2. **Fallback 1**: Mood keywords (no year filter) + validation
3. **Fallback 2**: Generic mood keyword + validation
4. **Fallback 3**: Genre-based search + validation
5. **Last Resort**: Unfiltered results (with warning)

## Example Validation

Test results from `test_mood_matching.py`:

**Target: Happy mood** (valence=0.8, energy=0.7, dance=0.7, tempo=120)

| Track                  | Score | Match Quality |
|------------------------|-------|---------------|
| Perfect Happy Match    | 0.000 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Perfect |
| Pretty Good Match      | 0.325 | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Great |
| High Energy but Sad    | 2.050 | ⭐⭐ Poor |
| Sad Song (Bad Match)   | 3.100 | ⭐ Very Poor |

## Technical Details

### Audio Features Used
- **Valence**: Musical positiveness (0 = negative/sad, 1 = positive/happy)
- **Energy**: Intensity and activity (0 = calm, 1 = energetic)
- **Danceability**: How suitable for dancing (0 = not danceable, 1 = very danceable)
- **Tempo**: Beats per minute (60-200 BPM typical range)

### Performance Considerations
- Batch audio feature requests (100 tracks at a time)
- Graceful degradation if audio features unavailable
- Maximum 50 search results to balance quality and API quotas
- Fallback strategies ensure users always get results

## User Experience

### Before
❌ "Sad" mood might show upbeat pop songs with "sad" in lyrics  
❌ All moods used same generic genres  
❌ No guarantee tracks matched the mood  

### After
✅ "Sad" mood shows acoustic, low-energy, low-valence tracks  
✅ Each mood has genre-appropriate results  
✅ Audio features validated for accurate mood matching  
✅ Users see success message: "✨ Found N tracks matching [Mood] mood characteristics!"

## Testing
Run `python3 test_mood_matching.py` to verify:
- Mood-to-genre mappings
- Track scoring algorithm
- Ranking by match quality

## Deployment
Changes automatically deployed to: https://enterpriseaidemo1websearch-bguldwgonwx8mtucjwymbq.streamlit.app

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)
- [ ] Add "acousticness" and "instrumentalness" to scoring
- [ ] Allow users to see match scores for each track
- [ ] Add "strict mode" that only shows perfect/great matches
- [ ] Cache audio features for better performance
- [ ] Add mood intensity slider (mild → intense)
