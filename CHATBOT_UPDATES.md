# 🎵 Chatbot Updates & Fixes

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
When you asked "I want to listen to Rauw Alejandro songs", the chatbot:
1. ❌ Tried to use your liked songs only
2. ❌ Failed to get audio features
3. ❌ Gave up with error message
4. ❌ Didn't search Spotify

### Solution
Now the chatbot has **two search modes**:

## 🎯 New Features

### 1️⃣ Artist Search
The chatbot now detects artist names and searches Spotify directly!

**Supported patterns:**
- "Play Rauw Alejandro"
- "Listen to Bad Bunny"
- "Songs by Taylor Swift"
- "Music by Drake"
- "Tracks by Ariana Grande"
- "I want to listen to [artist]"

**How it works:**
```
You: "Play Rauw Alejandro songs"
Bot: 🎵 Found 10 songs by Rauw Alejandro!
     [Shows tracks from Spotify search]
```

### 2️⃣ Smart Fallback for Mood Searches
When mood-based search fails with liked songs:
1. ✅ Tries your liked songs first (if connected)
2. ✅ Falls back to Spotify search automatically
3. ✅ Always returns results!

**Before:**
```
You: "Happy songs"
Bot: 😔 Sorry, I couldn't find any songs matching 'Happy' mood in your liked songs.
```

**After:**
```
You: "Happy songs"  
Bot: 🔍 Searching Spotify for mood-matching tracks...
     🎵 Found 10 happy tracks from Spotify!
     [Shows results]
```

### 3️⃣ No OAuth Required
You can now use the chatbot **without** connecting Spotify!

**What works without OAuth:**
- ✅ Artist search ("Play Bad Bunny")
- ✅ Mood search (falls back to Spotify)
- ✅ All chatbot features

**What requires OAuth:**
- Personalized recommendations from YOUR library
- Access to YOUR liked songs
