ðŸ“š SPOTIFY RECOMMENDATION SERVICE

This module contains the business logic for mood-based music recommendations.
It orchestrates the SpotifyClient to provide high-level functionality.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Service Layer Pattern: Business logic separate from API calls and UI
- Single Responsibility: Each method does ONE thing well
- Dependency Injection: Client passed in, not created here (testability)
- Error Handling: Convert technical errors to user-friendly messages

ARCHITECTURE:
- Models: Data structures (models.py)
- Client: API communication (client.py)
- Service: Business logic (this file)
- UI: User interface (app.py)
