logger.debug(f"Fetching audio features for {len(track_ids)} tracks")
logger.error(f"Spotify API error getting profile: {e}")
```

**CI/CD:**
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` configured

**Code Documentation:**
```python
"""
üìö CONCEPT: Dataclasses auto-generate __init__, __repr__, __eq__

üìù DESIGN: We default to "gpt-4o-mini" (fastest, cheapest for learning)

EXAMPLE:
>>> options = SearchOptions()  # Uses defaults
>>> options = SearchOptions(model="gpt-4o")  # Override for production
"""
```

## üî• Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Refactored Spotify App** (Major)
**Before:** 832-line monolithic `app.py`
**After:** Clean 4-layer architecture
- `spotify/models.py`: 106 statements, 97% tested
- `spotify/client.py`: 188 statements, 68% tested  
- `spotify/service.py`: 127 statements, 87% tested
- `app.py`: UI layer (to be further refactored)

### 2. **Added 70 Tests for Spotify** (Major)
**Before:** 0 tests for Spotify app
**After:** 70 comprehensive tests
- 31 tests for models (dataclasses, validation, calculations)
- 22 tests for client (mocking API calls)
- 17 tests for service (business logic)

### 3. **Implemented TDD Workflow** (Major)
**Before:** No evidence of TDD
**After:** Clear TDD pattern in git history
- Tests committed first (322ed8b)
- Features implemented to pass tests
- Mocks used to avoid real API calls

### 4. **Added Type Hints & Validation** (Medium)
**Before:** Minimal type hints
**After:** Complete type annotations
```python
def get_mood_recommendations(
    self,
    mood_preset: MoodPreset,
    limit: int = 10,
    use_user_library: bool = False,
    user_track_ids: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> List[Track]:
```

### 5. **Improved Error Handling** (Medium)
**Before:** Generic try/except blocks
**After:** Custom exception hierarchy
```python
raise APIError(
    f"Failed to get user profile: {e.msg}",
    status_code=e.http_status
)
```

### 6. **Added Enterprise Logging** (Medium)
**Before:** Basic print statements
**After:** Structured logging with levels
```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info(f"Retrieved {len(tracks)} tracks")
logger.debug(f"Searching tracks with query: {query}")
logger.error(f"Failed to create playlist: {e}")
```

### 7. **Conventional Commits** (Minor)
**Before:** Inconsistent commit messages
**After:** Proper conventional format
- `test:` for test additions
- `feat:` for features
- `docs:` for documentation
- `fix:` for bug fixes
